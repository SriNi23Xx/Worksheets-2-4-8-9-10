        <h1 style="background-color:tomato;"> Just me! </h1> 
        <p1 style="font-family:'Courier New'"> <strong> Hi readers, </strong> My name is Sri Nithish. I am a collector of republic coins, stamps and currency which led me to perceive a new India. My native Salem, located in the heart of the 
         Kongu belt. <br>  I spent most of my childhood in Coimbatore until my father's business shifted to Chennai. Me and my twin sister have been collecting various items as a hobby and as a medium to learn more <br> about India and the world in a fun and fascinating way. I conciousley make sure I never stop learning because it will be my key to attaing my dreams
        and goals. </p1>

        <h1 style="background-color:powderblue;"> My Aspirations </h1>
        <p2 style="font-family:'Courier New'"> My aspirations have evolved over the years from telling my friends and family about becoming a doctor in order to inject people who might trouble me to an architect and now eventually an entrepreneur. Over time, I have come to understand that I have skillsets and interest that are aligned in the field of buisness. My role model is the business tycoon Elon Musk. I like him because of his abilities and out-of-the-box techniques to manage a company, and his “never give up” attitude. Recently, I've gained an interest in art and artefact collection, where I dream to change the game and make the art of collecting rare arts and artifacts achieve its much deserved glory.</p2>

        <h1 style="background-color:rgb(176, 230, 185);"> My Lifestyle  </h1> 
        <p3 style="font-family:'Courier New'">  My usual school days are just a regualar routine. I wake up at around 6:00 am, finish my morning routines and pack my bag as per the day’s schedule. I then carry my bag downstairs and grab my snack and my drink for the day. My usual breakfast is kali, a protein packed traditional Tamil dish, that gives me the energy that I need for the day. I usually wear my socks and my shoes in my car just in time before the car enters the school premises. As soon as I enter my school I rush to my classroom, cramp my bag into my cubby and run downstairs to the basketball court. I enjoy playing basketball until my watch reminds me to go back to class. After school I am picked up by my grandmother who tells me exciting stories which entertain me throughout the journey. After I reach home, I  do my homework and go outside to greet my pet Ruby who loves playing with me. We play fetch and run around the villa. Occassionally, I play basketball on my own. I then have my dinner and crash into my bed giving my body its much needed rest. </p3>
